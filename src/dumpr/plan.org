* TODO Dumpr
 - [X] Handle out channel close by consumer in binlog streaming => Not a good idea, use close-binlog-stream instead.
 - [X] Make table load parallelism configurable => Not configurable but still works with large datasets ok.
 - [X] Document order preserving table load behavior (making it official)
 - [X] auto key detection on load + (manual override, if needed)
 - [X] Database filtering
 - [X] cache table schemas
 - [X] Convert text type columns to strings using proper encoding
 - [X] Automated tests for loading and streaming
 - [X] What happens if DB connection drops, can we reconnect?
 - [X] Validate given binlog stream start positition against available positions
 - [X] write good (enough) README
 - [X] decide licence and update
 - [X] stop event handling - No need, similar handling as DB connection loss
 - [ ] Automated tests for connection failures and resuming?
 - [ ] Create an example application that uses Dumpr library
 - [ ] channel metrics
 - [ ] Test nexted tx?
